What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
+ More logic to commints - control ower them
- I forget to do something that extends my work - and doing a version control is one of this things
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git 
Save all related staff 
Done manualy - after i do whole change 
Other
Save every thought - not only after the work is done 
Save automatically - after change or after set time
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Too hard
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Can get back without a problem
